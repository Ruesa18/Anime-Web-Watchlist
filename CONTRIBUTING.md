# Contributing Ground-Rules
First of all: You are very welcome to join and contribute to this little project.
Of course there have to be some ground-rules so we can work together.
These will always get published inside of this file. So please check it from time to time again. ;)

## Creating Issues
If you want a feature to get implemented feel free to add a request in the issues. 
Please try to use the templates and also try to answer all the named topics inside the template. 
This really helps to understand what the goal should be and why it's important.

Also I'm very thankful for bug reports. 
I've also created a template for this purpose and I'd be very happy if you could use this template in order to inform me of any problems. 
I think the template contains all the needed information for me to get started on any errors down the road.

Thank you for your motivation and time! :)
